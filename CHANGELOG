Release 0.1.0 (Jul 31, 2017)
----------------------------

Initial release. Accomplished parser that transforms snapshots from OSG to glidein jobs.


Release 0.1.1 (Jul 31, 2017)
----------------------------

Handle three corner cases that glidein jobs from PSC_Bridges, ISI, opensciencegrid.org misses
some attributes.


Release 0.1.2 (Aug 2, 2017)
---------------------------

1. We found a case that two sites - 'SU-OG', 'Purdue' - can run the same job at the same snapshot.
2. Some job in 'SU-OG' has two daemon names (111@SU-OG-151, 222@SU-OG-151) but with same job id and same host name (SU-OG-151).


Release 0.1.3 (Aug 4, 2017)
---------------------------
1. Add job LifecycleGenerator to take snapshot sequence as input and generate lifecycles once the job finishes.
2. FormattedLifecycle contains basic information from job lifecycle and also the total number of jobs running in the current snapshot.

Release 0.1.4 (Aug 5, 2017)

1. Move DEBUG and LABELING into constants.py. and initialize those global variables every time when running unit tests.
2. LifecycleGenerator.generate now returns lifecycles of finished jobs. (Previously it needs to call _format_lifecycle and return FormattedLifecycle objects.
3. snapshot directly passes activity_dict and state_dict to LifecycleGenerator. LifecycleGenerator also keeps track of its own activity_dict and state_dict along the job life time.

Bug fixes:
	1. to_retire and to_die in Job can be None, so we need to verify their values in JobLifecycle and other places.
